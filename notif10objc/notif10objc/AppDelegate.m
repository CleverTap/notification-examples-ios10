     If your delegate does not implement this method, the system silences alerts as if you had passed the UNNotificationPresentationOptionNone option to the completionHandler block. If you do not provide a delegate at all for the UNUserNotificationCenter object, the system uses the notification’s original options to alert the user.

     You specify your app’s notification types and custom actions using UNNotificationCategory and UNNotificationAction objects.

Even if you register custom actions, the action in the response parameter might indicate that the user dismissed the notification without performing any of your actions.
     
     If you do not implement this method, your app never responds to custom actions.
